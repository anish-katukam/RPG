Story
A necromancer seeks his destiny by travelling across generic barren plains. He was never able to use necromancy correctly and always needed the skull of power to use any necromancy at all. He learns that his power was sealed away by a great evil. He journeys to kill that evil and reclaim his power. 

(Anish writes code for this in main class)

Mechanics
Entity class
vitality (basic health, does not regenerate)
bloodlust (attack power multiplier, increases with consecutive hits, decreases with damage taken, resets every battle)
energy (allows usage of attacks, is, does not reset, can be replenished with potions)
            	name
            	attack()
Character extends Entity
            	Enemy extends Entity  

Weapons
            	Multiple types, have basic damage (decreases enemy’s health) and secondary attribute

Gear
            	Armor (increases defense, maybe vitality)
            	Rings (random attributes)
            	Hats (random attributes)
            	Potions (restores energy/increases bloodlust)

Equip Regions
            	-Only one armor, one hat, and two rings
            	- rest is kept in inventory
            	Weight system

Inventory
            	Can be accessed by user whenever
            	Uses codes to identify items, simple int codes will do, nothing fancy

TURN BASED

Your attack -
Choose a spell to cast - if not enough energy, can use basic attacks.
//calculate multipliers w/ bloodlust
Random change of gaining bloodlust
Energy decreases with spell usage
Factor energy regen/health regen in

Damage dealt to enemy - 
Apply bloodlusted damage, and any secondary effects

Their attack - 
idk sid do this, do u want them to have bloodlust or stuff like that

Damage dealt to you -
Apply their damage (bloodlusted or nah?) and then apply their secondary effects


VISUALS - 
Maybe use font coloring to display vitality (green), bloodlust(red), and energy (yellow) yellow looks bad - but maybe use background or something like that

e.g.
////////////////      100
/////////                  48
///////////////        79



GRAPHICS - 
For final project
USE SWORD AND SWORCERY GRAPHICS. THEY LOOK AMAZING.
not just for cutscenes - for whole game. this will take hella time.
FINDING ITEMS IN GAMEPLAY
